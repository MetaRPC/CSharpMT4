# Streaming Real-Time Quotes for a Symbol

> **Request:** subscribe to real‚Äëtime bid/ask price updates for a given symbol
> Opens a streaming channel to receive tick‚Äëby‚Äëtick quotes as the market changes.

---

## Code Example

```csharp
// --- Quick use (service wrapper) ---
// Subscribes to ticks for a single symbol. Exits on first tick or after the timeout.
await _service.ShowRealTimeQuotes("EURUSD", timeoutSeconds: 5);

// --- Low-level (direct account call) ---
// Preconditions: account is connected via ConnectByServerName/ConnectByHostPort.
// Tip: always pass a CancellationToken; streams are infinite by design.
using var cts = new CancellationTokenSource(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));
await foreach (var tick in _mt4.OnSymbolTickAsync(new[] { "EURUSD" }, cts.Token))
{
    var q = tick.SymbolTick;
    if (q == null) continue;

    Console.WriteLine($"Tick: {q.Symbol} {q.Bid}/{q.Ask} @ {q.Time}");
    break; // demo: leave after the first tick
}
```

## Method Signatures

### Service wrapper

```csharp
Task ShowRealTimeQuotes(
    string symbol,
    int timeoutSeconds = 5,
    CancellationToken ct = default
)
```

### Direct stream

```csharp
IAsyncEnumerable<SymbolTickData> OnSymbolTickAsync(
    string[] symbols,
    [EnumeratorCancellation] CancellationToken cancellationToken = default
)
```

## üîΩ Input

**Wrapper (`ShowRealTimeQuotes`)**

| Parameter        | Type                | Required | Description                                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `symbol`         | `string`            | ‚úÖ        | Symbol to subscribe (e.g., `"EURUSD"`).                              |
| `timeoutSeconds` | `int`               | ‚ùå        | Upper bound to wait for the first tick before stopping (default: 5). |
| `ct`             | `CancellationToken` | ‚ùå        | External cancellation (linked with internal timeout).                |

**Direct (`OnSymbolTickAsync`)**

| Parameter           | Type                | Required | Description                                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `symbols`           | `string[]`          | ‚úÖ        | One or more symbols (even a single one like `new[]{"EURUSD"}`). |
| `cancellationToken` | `CancellationToken` | ‚ùå        | Cancels the infinite stream.                                    |

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Output

Both variants deliver items of type **`SymbolTickData`**, which contains a **`QuoteData`** payload:

### Structure: `QuoteData`

| Field    | Type     | Description               |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| `Symbol` | `string` | Symbol name               |
| `Bid`    | `double` | Current bid price         |
| `Ask`    | `double` | Current ask price         |
| `Time`   | `string` | UTC timestamp of the tick |

> In the wrapper, the first received tick is printed to console and the method exits.

## üéØ Purpose

Use this to receive **live market data** for a symbol. Typical scenarios:

* Real‚Äëtime quote panels
* Alert engines that trigger on price movement
* Feeding pricing into automated strategies/UI overlays

---

## üß© Notes & Tips

* **Streams are infinite.** Always pass a `CancellationToken` (wrapper adds a timeout guard).
* **Server `Cancelled` != app cancellation.** Some servers respond with `StatusCode.Cancelled` when finalizing a subscription; client code treats this as **graceful completion** unless your token was cancelled with an error.
* **Reconnects.** Transient transport issues (`Unavailable`, `DeadlineExceeded`, `Internal`) are retried by the client‚Äôs internal stream wrapper with exponential backoff.
* **Many symbols?** Prefer a **single subscription** with multiple symbols over many per‚Äësymbol subscriptions.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Pitfalls

* **No first tick.** If the market is closed/illiquid or symbol is wrong, you may hit the timeout without any tick. Validate symbol names exactly as returned by `SymbolsAsync()`.
* **Over‚Äësubscribing.** Creating lots of simultaneous per‚Äësymbol streams can exhaust chart/session limits on the terminal. Batch symbols where possible.

---

## üß™ Testing

* **Happy path:** You should see at least one tick during active market hours.
* **Timeout path:** Use a tiny `timeoutSeconds` to verify graceful stop without exceptions.
* **Cancel path:** Cancel the token and ensure the app exits the loop cleanly without leaking tasks.
