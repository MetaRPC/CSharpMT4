```csharp
// Using service wrapper
await _service.StreamTradeUpdates();

// Or directly from MT4Account
await foreach (var trade in _mt4.OnTradeAsync())
{
    Console.WriteLine("Trade update received.");
    break; // for test/demo purposes
}
```

### Method Signature

```csharp
IAsyncEnumerable<OnTradeData> OnTradeAsync(
    [EnumeratorCancellation] CancellationToken cancellationToken = default
)
```

---

## üîΩ Input

No parameters required, except:

* **`cancellationToken`** (`CancellationToken`, optional) ‚Äî used to cancel the stream manually.

---

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Output

Returns a stream (`IAsyncEnumerable<OnTradeData>`) where each item represents a trade event:

| Field       | Type        | Description                         |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `TradeInfo` | `TradeInfo` | Structure containing trade details. |

Structure of `TradeInfo`:

| Field       | Type     | Description                              |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `Ticket`    | `int`    | Unique ID of the trade order             |
| `Symbol`    | `string` | Trading symbol (e.g., "EURUSD")          |
| `Lots`      | `double` | Trade volume in lots                     |
| `OpenPrice` | `double` | Price at which the trade was opened      |
| `Profit`    | `double` | Current profit or loss of the trade      |
| `OpenTime`  | `string` | UTC timestamp when the trade was opened  |
| `OrderType` | `string` | Type of trade (e.g., Buy, Sell)          |
| `Comment`   | `string` | Custom comment associated with the trade |
| `Magic`     | `int`    | Magic number used to tag the trade       |

---

## üéØ Purpose

Use this method to subscribe to **real-time trade activity** ‚Äî executed orders, closed positions, and trade events sent by the server. Suitable for:

* Updating dashboards or client UIs in real-time
* Triggering post-trade logic (e.g. logging, risk checks)
* Auditing trade flow in automated systems

---

### ‚ùì Notes

This stream is **endless by nature** ‚Äî unless filtered or cancelled manually. The wrapper method in `_service` uses a `break;` for demo purposes, but production code should handle stream lifecycle properly with cancellation tokens or filtering logic.
