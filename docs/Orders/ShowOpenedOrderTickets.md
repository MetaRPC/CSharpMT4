# Getting Opened Order Tickets

> **Request:** fetch only the tickets (IDs) of currently opened orders
> Retrieve a lightweight ticket list without full order details.

---

### Code Example

```csharp
// --- Quick use (service wrapper) ---
await _service.ShowOpenedOrderTickets();

// --- Low-level (direct account call) ---
// Preconditions: account is connected via ConnectByServerName/ConnectByHostPort.

var result = await _mt4.OpenedOrdersTicketsAsync(
    deadline: null,
    cancellationToken: default);

foreach (var ticket in result.Tickets)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Open Order Ticket: {ticket}");
}
```

---

### Method Signatures

```csharp
// Service wrapper (example implementation)
Task ShowOpenedOrderTickets();
```

```csharp
// Low-level account call
Task<OpenedOrdersTicketsData> OpenedOrdersTicketsAsync(
    DateTime? deadline = null,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default
);
```

---

## üîΩ Input

No required parameters.

Optional:

* **`deadline`** (`DateTime?`) ‚Äî optional UTC deadline for the call.
* **`cancellationToken`** (`CancellationToken`) ‚Äî optional cancellation token.

---

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Output

Returns **`OpenedOrdersTicketsData`** with:

| Field     | Type        | Description                                   |
| --------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `Tickets` | `List<int>` | List of ticket IDs for currently open orders. |

Each ticket is an `int` that uniquely identifies an open trade in MT4.

---

## üéØ Purpose

Use this when you only need IDs, e.g. for quick matching/sync, or to feed targeted operations like **Close/Delete** or **Close By** without fetching full order rows. Minimal bandwidth versus `OpenedOrdersAsync()`.

---

## üß© Notes & Tips

* **Int32 boundary.** MT4 tickets are `int`. If your app stores them as `long`, ensure values fit into `Int32` before sending to close/modify APIs.
* **Empty ‚â† error.** An empty list simply means there are no open orders right now.
* **Freshness.** In volatile markets, fetch tickets right before acting; another process may open/close orders in between.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Pitfalls

* **Race conditions.** A ticket can disappear between listing and action; handle `ApiExceptionMT4` from subsequent calls (e.g., *Ticket not found*).

---

## üß™ Testing Suggestions

* **Happy path.** Open a small market order; verify its ticket appears in the list.
* **No orders.** Close all trades and confirm the method returns an empty `Tickets` list without errors.
