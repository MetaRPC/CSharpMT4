# Closing an Order

> **Request:** close or delete an open order by its ticket
> Sends a request to the server to close or delete the specified order.

---

### Code Example

```csharp
// --- Quick use (service wrapper) ---
await _service.CloseOrderExample(123456);

// --- Low-level (direct account call) ---
// Preconditions: account is connected via ConnectByServerName/ConnectByHostPort.

var request = new OrderCloseDeleteRequest
{
    OrderTicket = 123456 // must be a valid ticket ID
};

var result = await _mt4.OrderCloseDeleteAsync(
    request: request,
    deadline: null,
    cancellationToken: default);

Console.WriteLine($"Closed/Deleted: {result.Mode}, Comment: {result.HistoryOrderComment}");
```

---

### Method Signatures

```csharp
// Service wrapper (example implementation)
Task CloseOrderExample(long ticket);
```

```csharp
// Low-level account call
Task<OrderCloseDeleteData> OrderCloseDeleteAsync(
    OrderCloseDeleteRequest request,
    DateTime? deadline = null,
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default
);
```

## üîΩ Input

* **`request`** (`OrderCloseDeleteRequest`) ‚Äî fields:

  | Field         | Type  | Description                                               |
  | ------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `OrderTicket` | `int` | **Required.** Ticket number of the order to close/delete. |

Optional:

* **`deadline`** (`DateTime?`) ‚Äî optional per-call deadline.
* **`cancellationToken`** (`CancellationToken`) ‚Äî to cancel the request.

> The ticket must correspond to a **currently open** order; otherwise the server returns errors like *Invalid ticket* or *Ticket not found*.

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Output

Returns **`OrderCloseDeleteData`** with:

| Field                 | Type     | Description                                            |
| --------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Mode`                | `string` | Operation result mode (e.g., `"Closed"`, `"Deleted"`). |
| `HistoryOrderComment` | `string` | Server comment explaining the result.                  |

> The actual action (close **vs** delete) is determined by the server based on the order state/type.

## üéØ Purpose

Close or delete an order by its ticket ‚Äî convenient for:

* Manual trade intervention from UI/debug tools
* Post-trade cleanup
* Simulating close workflows in sandbox/testing

---

## üß© Notes & Tips

* **Ticket range.** The wire type is `int`. If you store tickets as `long`, ensure the value fits into `Int32` before sending (the wrapper does this check).
* **State matters.** Market positions are typically **closed**; pending orders are typically **deleted** ‚Äî the server sets `Mode` accordingly.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Pitfalls

* **Invalid/closed ticket.** Calling the method for a non-open ticket yields an API error ‚Äî handle `ApiExceptionMT4`.
* **Race conditions.** Another process might close the ticket between fetching and sending your request; retry logic should be at the caller level if needed.

---

## üß™ Testing Suggestions

* **Happy path.** Use a fresh open ticket from `OpenedOrdersAsync()`; verify `Mode` and that the ticket disappears from the open-orders list.
* **Failure path.** Try an obviously invalid ticket and assert that an `ApiExceptionMT4` is thrown and logged without crashing.
