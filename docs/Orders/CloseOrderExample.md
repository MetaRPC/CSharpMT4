Console.WriteLine($"Closed/Deleted: {result.Mode}, Comment: {result.HistoryOrderComment}");
```

###  Method Signature

```csharp

## üéØ Purpose

This method allows closing or deleting an order manually by ticket ‚Äî useful for:

* Manual trade intervention from UI/debug tool
* Post-trade cleanup
* Simulating close workflows in sandbox/testing

---

### ‚ùì Why it's commented out in code:

This method requires a **valid, active ticket number**. Since demo or test environments may not have such a ticket readily available, it‚Äôs commented out by default to:

* ‚ùå Avoid runtime exceptions from invalid ticket errors
* ‚úÖ Encourage intentional use only when real ticket IDs are known

To test it, provide a known valid open order ticket ‚Äî or use one received from `OpenedOrdersAsync()`.
